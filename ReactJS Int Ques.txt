
1) What is React JS?
====================

a) A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
b) React is used to build single-page applications.
c) React allows us to create reusable UI components.

2) Why react js is used?
==========================

a) Flexibility: React is very flexible and can be used to build a variety of applications and UI components. 
You can use it to build web apps, mobile apps, and even virtual reality experiences.
b) Great developer experience: React has a simple API and uses JavaScript and HTML to build components. 
This makes it easy to learn and provides a good developer experience.
c) Large community: React has a massive community of developers who share knowledge, create libraries, 
and help support each other. There are many open source React components and libraries available.
d) Performance: React uses a virtual DOM and intelligently updates only parts of the UI that have changed. 
This makes React apps fast and efficient.
e) Testability: React components are self-contained and easily testable. There are many tools available to 
test React components and apps.

3) How does React Js work? 
==========================

Server and Client
CDN delivers the client a single file on the handshake i.e. index.html
index.html contains bundle.js 
bundle.js contains a lot of javascript code
The client has to execute javascript first inorder to understand what the page should look like.
CDN knows how to present file does not knows how to compute.

4) Features of react js
=======================

a) JSX
React uses JSX, which is a JavaScript extension syntax. It allows us to write HTML directly in JavaScript. 
JSX makes it easier to visualize what the UI will look like. When compiled, JSX expressions turn into React.createElement() 
calls.
  const heading = <h1>Hello!</h1>;
Compiles to:
  const heading = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello!');
  
b) Components
Components are the building blocks of any React app. They allow you to split the UI into independent, reusable pieces.
  
  function Welcome(props) {
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>; 
  }
  
c) One-Way Data Binding
React follows a one-way data flow. Data flows from parent components to child components via props. This makes the data 
flow predictable and efficient.

d) Virtual DOM
React uses a virtual DOM instead of modifying the real DOM directly. When state or props change, React efficiently 
updates the real DOM by only modifying what has changed.

This makes React fast and scalable.

e) Simplicity
React has a simple API that makes it easy to learn and use. Components are simple JavaScript functions.


5) What is jsx
===============

JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a JavaScript syntax extension that allows us to write HTML in React.
Some key points about JSX:
a) It makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.
b) JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without manually calling React.createElement()
c) JSX is transformed to React.createElement() calls under the hood by tools like Babel.
d) We can write JavaScript expressions inside curly braces {} in JSX.
e) We cannot write if/else statements directly in JSX. We can use conditional expressions like ternary operators.
f) All attribute names in JSX are written in camelCase.

6) How to create components in React js
========================================

Components are independent and reusable bits of code.
Components are the building blocks of any React application. They let you split the UI into independent and reusable pieces.
There are two ways to create components in React:

Function Components
Class Components

a) Function Components
Function components are the preferred way to create components in React. They are simple JavaScript functions that accept 
props and return JSX.
  function Welcome(props) {
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
  }
Here Welcome is a function component that accepts props as an argument and returns some JSX.

You can use a function component like this:
  <Welcome name="Sara" />
b) Class Components

A class component requires:

A class which extends React.Component
A render() method that returns JSX

class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
  <Welcome name="Sara" />
Function components are preferred over class components because:

They are cleaner and more concise.
They allow us to use React Hooks which enable state and lifecycle features without writing a class.

7) What are the advantages of React JS?
8) Differentiate between real DOM and Virtual DOM
9) What are froms in React JS
10) How is React different from React Native 

Q) Hook
Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. 
Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.


1) Hooks
useState
useeffect
useContext
useReducer
useMemo
useCallback
useRef

2) Higher order component

3) Life cycle methods of component. 

4) State management 
- State/Props
- Prop drilling
- Context 

5) Redux/ Zustand

6) Custom hooks

7) Lazy loading
- Code splitting
- Chunking
- Suspense

8) Virtual DOM
- reconciliation
- react fiber

9) SSR and CSRF

10) Routing
dynamic routing

11) Async task

Promises
callback hell
